# Operating Systems Lab Work

This is the labwork repository of the second-year Operating Systems course (TI2726-C) of Delft University of Technology.
The repository contains frames for every assignment solution as well as the assignments in markdown format.

## Getting the code

To get started, you can either clone the repository to your machine:

    git clone https://github.com/tu-os-course/assignments.git
    
    # to update the repository (only possible if you do not have local changes)
    git pull origin master
    
or [download the zip](https://github.com/tu-os-course/assignments/archive/master.zip).

If you want to learn git, [start here](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1).

Although you're free to clone the repository, you should of course **NOT** publish your solutions to Github.
**No spoilers!**

## Handing in

You're expected to hand in only a single C file, namely the one as given in the template solution.
Your solution should **not** depend on any changes you make to the makefile, as we will compile it against the makefile as is.

## Contributing

1. Open [an issue](https://github.com/tu-os-course/assignments/issues/new)
2. Fork, fix and open a pull request
